    "Climate observations prior to the instrumental era are necessarily indirect. These observations are made on climate proxies in various geological (e.g. lake or marine sediments, living or fossil coral reefs, cave deposits), glaciological (ice cores or snow pits) or biological (trees) archives. Many types of data can often be collected from each archives, each sensing a different aspect of the environment (sometimes, several aspects at once). A paleoclimate dataset is almost always a time series of observations made on an archive.\n",
